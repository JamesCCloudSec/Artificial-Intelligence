# AI Saturation While Job Seeking
I am writing this document completely by hand out of principle despite most of my repositories being AI and here's why:

I like AI. I think it is useful. I do the projects and work, AI creates an accurate document outlining what I did. It allows me to do more of the things that make humans special. That being said, using AI for every single thing one can possibly think of is killing creativity and cognitive function. Specifically, job seeking is at a point in history no one has ever seen.

## My Experience
I began my job search three days ago with about 20 applications, so I am just beginning. I have listed my achievements, projects, and volunteer work for AI, which produced what I call my master resume, a general document. For every job, I have the AI tailor it to a job description, and I organize the document by role and enter it into a spreadsheet with a scheduled follow up. I thought this was great, until I thought, I cannot be the only person doing this. It turns out, I'm not, and it is worse. So much worse.

I decided to research it a little, and I found reddit posts of job seekers discussing their AI application tools, that not only write the resume, but tailor it, and mass apply to hundreds or thousands of job listings. It gets worse though, there are bots that message the hiring managers themselves with a tailored message, overwhelming inquiries into a vast majority of AI garbage.

I saw from a hiring perspective, teams are completely overwhelmed by AI messages, cover letters, and applications.

**Recruiter cmh_ender:**  
*"For everyone that is having a hard time getting a call back for a job, I know right now we are being hammered with fake AI resumes. our team calculated 97% of applicants are phantoms. All of these services that mass apply for you with targeted resumes are killing us. we may have to go to only in person interviews (even though we offer full remote jobs) just to cut down on the applicant pool.
We are writing our own tools now to fight AI with AI, but dang, this sucks."*

Why has it come to this? One user described it as an arms race. ATS, AI analyzers, and keyword buzzing is what really started it. People were being autodenied with no warning because their resume lacked the key words necessary for the role. Now, on the hiring side, AI is getting more advanced in detection and filtering, forcibly so by the overwhelming quantity of AI content.  

**Unique_Brilliant2243:**  
*"They started it with automated scanning of CVs."*  
**Reponse to Unique_Brilliant2243 by Atomsk404:**  
*"Used to be all handshakes and gut feelings. They started an arms race and are sad we've got weapons."*  

Guess what? Job seekers then evolve their AI contributions, until it becomes a back and forth problem where no one at all benefits from any of it. Job seekers are drowned out, hiring teams are flooded, qualified workers are lost, unqualified are overwhelming systems, cannot even remedy it by approaching it as a human, because AI is learning to replicate even that.

So where are we? I don't know. I am a baby in this market. I just have enough thought to question my own usage so that I may learn to be heard through the ocean of phantom applications.
